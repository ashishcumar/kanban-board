# Kanban Board Project

This is a simple and interactive Kanban board built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. It allows users to create, manage, and organize tasks through a user-friendly interface. I'm revisiting and practicing raw HTML, CSS, and JavaScript through this project, as it's been a while since I last worked with these technologies directly.

- **Drag and Drop Functionality:** Drag and drop cards between different stages (Ideas, In Progress, In Review, Completed) to track task progress visually.
- **Persistent Data:** All changes (new cards, updated statuses) are saved locally, so data is preserved even after page refreshes.
