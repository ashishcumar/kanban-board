# Kanban Board Project

This is a simple and interactive Kanban board built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. It allows users to create, manage, and organize tasks through a user-friendly interface. I'm revisiting and practicing raw HTML, CSS, and JavaScript through this project, as it's been a while since I last worked with these technologies directly.
